Parallel programming with PyCOMPSs
==================================

`PyCOMPSs <https://www.bsc.es/research-and-development/software-and-apps/software-list/comp-superscalar/>`__ is a parallel programming model that aims to ease the
development of applications for distributed computing platforms (i.e, HPC clusters, clouds, or container-managed infrastructures).

This poster will give an overview of PyCOMPSs, including new
features, such as: the ability of reading/writing from streamed data, failure management at task level,  and integration with NUMBA.

The poster will also include a section for the `dislib <https://dislib.bsc.es/en/stable/>`__, a machine learning
library parallelized with PyCOMPSs.

This poster is divided in the following sections:
